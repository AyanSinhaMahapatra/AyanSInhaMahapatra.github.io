I've just started chasing my dreams of knowing how the Brain works, and here I document my experiences, opinions, materials that I compiled and hope that it'll be useful for others, book reviews, tutorials on EEG processing related topics and more! 

This page acts as an index to all my Neuroscience related blog posts. Cheers!
