Say you've heard the terms Data Science/Machine Learning somewhere quite sometime ago. 
You are genuinely interested in that work, you've started some MOOC's, played with some datasets, have a small project. Now, what's next? What's best for you? 

It's surprising that even though you maybe interested in completely different applications, unique career paths, but still Kaggle is the best answer for nearly all of them. It's currently the best way to learn, test your skills, and get your hands dirty in the truest sense. 

So whatever you know about Data Science, if you wish to do better than you are doing, you should be spending more time in Kaggle.
